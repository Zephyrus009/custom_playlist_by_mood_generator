Noa,Path To Follow,/n/noa/path+to+follow_10194425.html,"I found a path to follow  
I knew it straight away  
Now that I found it I won' t stray  
No, I will not stray,  
Not stray.  
  
I walk through the woods and holler  
The songbirds will laugh and play  
They know I' ve found it and won' t stray  
No, I will not stray,  
Not stray.  
  
The woods are alive with laughter  
The rivers are drunk with mirth  
They all know what I' ve been after  
They' re rejoicing for my rebirth,  
For my rebirth.  
  
I found a path to follow  
But it' s a path for two  
Why don' t you come here beside me  
I won' t stray, no, I will not stray  
From you.

Crowded House,Better Be Home Soon,/c/crowded+house/better+be+home+soon_20034423.html,"Somewhere deep inside, something's got a hold on you  
And it's pushing me aside, see it stretch on forever  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
  
Stripping back the coats of lies and deception  
Back to nothingness like a week in the desert  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
  
So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong  
'Cause when you get back home maybe I'll be gone, oh  
  
It would cause me pain if we were to end it  
But I could start again, you can depend on it  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life

But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.  
  
I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.  
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see  
the doctor anyway.  
  
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.  
  
I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow  
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,  
And that would never never do

With busted handle bars out in the rain.  
Somebody must have an orphanage for  
All these things that nobody wants any more  
September's reminding July  
It's time to be saying good-bye  
Summer is gone, Our love will remain  
Like old broken bicycles out in the rain  
  
Broken bicycles, don't tell my folks  
There's all those playing cards pinned to the spokes  
Laid down like skeletons out on the lawn  
The wheels won't turn when the other has gone  
The seasons can turn on a dime  
Somehow I forget every time  
For all the things that you've given me  
Will always stay, there broken but I'll never throw them away

And she'd read me a story  
It always was about a princess in distress

I'd rather rescue myself  
  
Someday I'm gonna find someone who wants my soul, heart, and mind  
Who's not afraid to show that he loves me  
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am  
Don't need nobody taking care of me  
I will be there for him just as strong as he, will be there for me  
When I give myself then it has got to be, an equal thing

We got lasers, cds, microchips, and fat free fat these days  
Well that's all fine but I got a mind that's changing to fast for me  
'Cause what I thought was new last month this month is history  
I got a brand new vcr, it's got 29, 000 functions  
And I can't make the damn thing work so there goes Petticoat Junction  
That's when I got the best idea I think I had in years  
I think I'll be cool and invent the tool that'll fax me a beer  
  
Would you all please fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on it's ear  
Yeah, makin' old whiskey that was riskey but this is all in the clear  
Sit back, relax, and punch ol' fax and I'll fax you a beer  
  
Japan and Germany they got nothing on us you see  
Why this is the latest and good ol' American high technology  
And when this hits the marketplace Uncle Sam will rule the world  
Well hold on cause I'm working on a machine that'll faxa real live girl

And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,  
Don't put on any airs when you're down on rue morgue avenue,

Sweet melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of doom,  
She speaks good english and she invites you up into her room.  
And you're so kind, too careful not to go to her too soon,  
Then she steals your voice and leaves you howling at the moon!  
  
Up on housing project hill it's either fortune or fame,  
You must pick one or the other though neither of them is what they claim,  
If you're lookin' to get silly you'd better go back to from where you came,  
Because the cops don't need you and man they expect the same!  
  
I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff,  
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,

Leather bang pounding on his back  
Above the clouds the moon was climbing higher  
A pack of wolves wanted their money back  
  
With folded arms the chief stood watching  
Painted braves slipped down the hill  
In his ears the spirit talking  
As they closed in  
For an easy kill  
  
At the house the door was wide open  
Wind blew curtains off the rod  
She was waiting and hoping  
She was praying to her god  
  
He was luckier than most men  
He was barely in his prime  
As she stood their in the doorway  
Her long dress flowing  
Would he make it this time  
  
Over the hill in the big green country  
That's the place where the cancer cowboy rides  
Pure as the driven snow before it got him  
Sometimes I feel like he's all right  
  
Sometimes I feel like a piece of paper  
Sometimes I feel like my own name  
Sometimes I feel different later  
Sometimes I feel  
I feel just the same

The kind that make you wanna put the games away  
Think about the future, but first I'll say  
Hello, good evening  
  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
What are you doing here?  
Oh Miss Right, wasn't expecting you tonight

How about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life

Spend forever looking, all the time wasting  
Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit  
Turn the corner and there my future sits

Somewhere under all that lace  
Standin' in her mama's high heeled shoes  
With a lipstick covered face  
And here's a little boy on a pony  
He's a cowboy all the way  
He used to pull my hair and make me mad  
At the Saturday matinee  
Who would've thought that I'd lose my heart  
To the same little boy someday

Faded photographs

And open up the past again  
And let me dream inside

Thought he'd washed the paint away  
He took a job that took him West  
He's doing very well  
We don't see much of brother these days  
And this is my favorite of my papa  
He's dressed up in his Sunday suit  
A wide brimmed hat, a watch on a chain  
Well, I'm gonna tell you the truth  
It's a picture of a downright handsome man  
Caught in the prime of his youth  
  
Lookin' through my old pictures  
Faded photographs

And this is for my homies that get high with me  
Just crack the Phillie open cause we keep on smoking

Feet soaking in the ocean  
On a tropical Island staying sunny  
We outta Phillies take these skins somebody roll a Mummy

So vast this heavy load

And the leaders seem to lose control

Shall we burn ourselves for the answer  
Have we found the place that we're looking for

Iron Maiden,The Legacy,/i/iron+maiden/the+legacy_20496810.html,"Tell you a thing  
That you ought to know  
Two minutes of your time  
Then on you go  
  
Tell tale of the men  
All dressed in black  
That most of them  
Not coming back  
  
Sent off to the war  
To play little games  
And on their return  
Can't name no names  
  
Some strange yellow gas  
Has played with their minds  
Has reddened their eyes  
Removed all the lies  
  
And strange as it sounds  
Death knows no bounds  
How many get well  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
You lie in your death bed now  
But what did you bring to the table  
Brought us only holy sin  
Utter trust is a deadly thing  
  
To the prayer of holy peace  
We didn't know what was lying underneath  
So how could we be such fools  
And to think that we thought you the answer  
  
I can't begin to understand in all the lies  
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes  
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow  
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now  
  
Tangled up in a web of lies  
Could have been a way to prophesise  
Unaware of the consequence  
Not aware of the secrets that you kept  
  
Nothing that we could believe  
To reveal the facade of faceless men  
Not a thing that we could foresee  
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome  
  
You had us all strung out with  
Promises of peace  
But all along you cover plan was to deceive  
Can it put to rights now only time will tell  
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well  
  
Left to all our golden sons  
All to pick up on the peace  
You could have given all of them  
A little chance, at least  
  
Take the world to a better place  
Given them all just a little hope  
Just think what a legacy  
You know, will leave  
  
We seem destined to live in fear  
And some that would say Armageddon is near  
But where there's a life while there's hope  
That man won't self destruct  
  
Why can't we treat our fellow men  
With more respect and a shake of their hands  
But anger and loathing is rife  
The death on all sides is  
Becoming a way of life  
  
We live in an uncertain world  
Fear understanding and ignorance  
Is leading to death  
Only the corpses are left  
For vultures that prey on their bones  
  
But some are just not wanting peace  
Their whole life is death and misery  
The only thing that they know  
Fight fire with fire life is cheap  
  
But if they do stop to think  
That man is teetering right on the brink  
But do you think that they care  
They benefit from death and pain and despair

Becomes a sadder place

You wake with ghosts

Which trip costs you more  
Between the ever restless crowds  
  
And the silence of your room  
Spend an hour in no man's land  
You'll be leaving soon  
  
Victims come and victims go  
There's always lots to spare  
  
One victim lives the tragedy  
One victim stops to stare  
  
And still another walks on by  
Pretending not to see  
They're all out there in no man's land  
'Cause it's the safest place to be  
  
But sanctuary never comes  
Without some kind of risk  
Illusions without freedom  
  
Never quite add up to bliss  
The haunting and the haunted  
Play a game no one can win  
The spirits come at midnight  
  
And by dawn they're gone again  
And so it seems our destiny  
To search and never rest  
To ride that ever changing wave  
That never seems to crest  
To shiver in the darkest night  
Afraid to make a stand  
And then go back and do our time  
Out there in no man's land

She was clean  
The best thing he had ever seen  
She looked just like those girls he saw in Playboy magazine  
They were lost  
They were looking for the easy dream  
Living high on borrowed time and running low on self-esteem  
They were lost  
They were helpless to the rush  
It felt just like a white drug  
Everybody says they're looking for the fairy tale  
No, they are just looking for a way to fall  
Everybody says they're looking for the happy ending  
No, they are just looking for a way to fall soft  
Just like anyone, they are just like everyone  
They were looking for the easy way to have it all  
Everybody says that they are looking for the true love lost  
True love lost  
True love lost  
True love lost

The absence, of color, surrounds a broken dream.  
Call my eyes to take me there  
One by one I watch, as the pieces disappear,  
My friends become the ones I hate.  
This house of cards it, won't withstand the wind.

Every time I close my eyes, dream in Columbian.  
All my bugs are comin' back.  
Crawlin' on my face, they speak in!

We slash and we strike see your head on a spike  
  
Once free and so brave, now your people are slaves, oh...  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - the sons of Anu rise, the fields of blood are mine  
On a burning horse I ride  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - ravager of towns our covenant is bound  
In your kingdom underground  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - rape our enemies, burn their village bright  
In a golden wall of light  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - blood runs from the sky, the veils of death divide  
And the crucified arise - RAIN OF FIRE!!!

And there's a weepy old willow  
He really knows how to cry,  
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Owl City,Peppermint Winter,/o/owl+city/peppermint+winter_20895343.html,"There's the snow,  
Look out below,  
And bundle up 'cause here it comes,  
Run outside,  
So starry-eyed,  
A snowball fight breaks out,  
And winter has finally begun...  
  
I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace 'til I slip on the sidewalk
and fall on my face,  
This peppermint winter is so sugar-sweet,  
I don't need to taste to believe,  
What's December without Christmas Eve?  
  
Hop in the sleigh,  
And we'll glide away into the night,  
And we'll sip on moonlight,  
Runny nose,  
My frosty toes are getting cold but I feel alive so I smile wide  
  
The snowflakes start falling and I start to float 'til my mean older brother
stuffs snow down my coat,  
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet,  
I don't need to taste to believe,  
What's December without Christmas Eve?

Yes and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused  
Oh but I'm alright I'm alright just weary to my bones  
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home so far away from home  
  
Don't know a soul who has not been battered  
Don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to its knees  
Oh but it's alright it's alright for we've lived so well so long  
Still when I think of the road we're traveling on I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it I wonder what's gone wrong  
  
And I dreamed I was dying I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
Looking back down at me smiled reassuredly  
I dreamed I was flying high up above my eyes could clearly see  
The statue of liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was flying  
  
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower come on the ship that sails the
moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hours and sing an American tune  
Oh but it's alright it's alright can't be forever blessed  
Still tomorrow's gonna be another working day and I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying to get some rest

When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away

Vexation of the soul is vanity  
Destruction of the poor is their poverty  
The poor man's wealth is in a holy, holy place  
Why do you fight eachother  
Why do you kill your brother  
Then your reward will be the cemetery  
We got to build a better nation  
Clean up, clean up Jah creation  
Or there will be no future for you, you and me

You harmed her, no reason why  
She fuckin hates yeah you

She tried to give you everything  
You just threw it away  
Turned it into bullshit  
And runned away  
  
Girl:  
Now its your turn  
To cry and beg  
For some miracle from your god  
And whine like a hog  
Everthing that comes  
Goes by  
Its your turn  
I hope you die  
In the shadow of the Valley of Death  
  
Marilyn:  
Shes now looking for me  
Someone who does aprecciate  
Like drugs for life  
  
Don't believe you let her go  
Now she gets me high high  
While you beg and fuck

Now she sees the real thing  
Doesn't know  
Why she cryed for a motherfucker like you  
Like you... Like you.....

Spin you round in the torture before the dread  
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner  
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter

All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up  
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode

Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line  
Everyone who wins in the great escape  
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake

If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait

Done saying, I'm done playing  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house, need to get out more  
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising  
Most people in my position get complacent  
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages  
I'm quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it  
I'm the only one that's putting shots up  
And like a potluck, you need to come with it  
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100  
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from
it  
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?  
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?""  
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there

No dinners, no holidays, no nothing

My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, ""Nah, fuck that
shit  
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit""  
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear  
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself  
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit  
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me
like I'm ""him"" now  
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now  
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down  
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Yoko Ono,A Thousand Times Yes,/y/yoko+ono/a+thousand+times+yes_20148523.html,"I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,  
I prayed a thousand times yes.  
And the no that was hanging over the buildings  
Faded like the moon at dawn.  
  
When I was young I thought I was facing  
A very aware world ahead,  
I didn't know it was going to be  
""beware of dogs"" instead.  
  
I said no, I said no, I said no,  
I said no a million times to no.  
But the yes that was in its last breath  
Still hovered in a room with a permanent flu.  
  
When I was young I didn't know  
That one can only read life in braille,  
I was still struggling to catch life on its tail.  
  
I said why, I said why, I said why,  
I asked why for the billionth time.  
And my bone slowly lost its moist  
Like a leftover coke bottle on the street.  
  
Yes, this dry whiteness of a thing on the square,  
that's my bone.  
It lets the wind pass over like the last tender fraud,  
Makes a little noise like old campaign billboard.  
  
I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,  
I prayed a thousand times yes.  
And the no that was hanging over faded.

There's not a light left in this room, just a shadow of a doubt  
So let's make sure we don't give up  
Before we've thought this through enough  
  
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight  
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds  
I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right  
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight

Songs as a seduction of sirens  
The elf-folk is calling me  
  
Tapio, Bear-king, Ruler of the forest  
Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the I'll and sad  
Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path  
  
The way to the lands  
Where as a hero I stand  
The path where Beauty met the Beast  
Elvenpath  
It's the honesty of these worlds  
Ruled by magic and mighty swords  
That makes my soul long for the past  
Elvenpath  
  
The moonwitch took me to a ride on a broomstick  
Introduced me to her old friend home gnome  
Told me to keep the sauna warm for him  
  
At the grove I met the rest - the folk of my fantasies  
Bilbo, Sparhawk, goblins and pixies  
Snowman, Willow, trolls and the seven dwarves  
The path goes forever on  
  
The way to the lands  
Where as a hero I stand  
The path where Beauty met the Beast  
Elvenpath  
It's the honesty of these worlds  
Ruled by magic and mighty swords  
That makes my soul long for the past  
Elvenpath  
  
Spoken, male:  
Long ago,  
In the early years of the Second Age,  
Great elven smiths forged rings of power.  
  
Sung, female:  
As I return to my room  
And as sleep takes me by my hand  
Madrigals from the woods  
Carry me to neverland  
In this spellbound night  
The world's an elvish sight  
In this spellbound night  
The world's an elvish sight  
  
But then, the Dark Lord learned  
The craft of ring making and made the master ring.

Torn by the arrival of Autumn.  
The blink of an eye, you know it's me.  
You keep the dagger close at hand.  
And you saw nothing.  
False love turned to pure hate.  
The wind cried a lamentation,  
before merging with the grey.  
Demon of the fall.  
Gasping for another breath.  
She rose, screaming at closed doors.  
  
Seductive faint mist forging  
through the cracks in the wall.  
I shan't resist.  
In tears for all of eternity.  
She turned around and faced me for the first time.  
Run away, run away.  
Just one second, and I was left with nothing.  
Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air.  
That day came to an end.  
And she had lost in me, her credence.

Where you're at sometimes  
Is your back against the wall?  
Or just across the line  
Have you been standing in the rain  
Reciting nursery rhymes?  
Trying to recall  
Some long lost kind of peace of mind  
Peace of mind  
Try spending the night sometime  
All alone in a frozen room  
Afterneath you've lain  
Your Saddle in the rain  
  
I dreamed they locked God up  
Down in my basement  
And he waited there for me  
To have this accident  
So he could drink my wine  
And eat me like a sacrament  
And I just stood there like I do  
Then I came and went  
I came and went  
Like a bird in a foreign sky  
Couldn't even say good bye  
Or come and share the pain  
My Saddle's in the rain  
  
I saw a friend who doesn't know  
If I'm his friend just yet  
His eyes and mouth were widely open  
And his jaw was set  
Like he'd fell off a cliff  
And hadn't hit the bottom yet  
I wish he wouldn't pull those things on me  
Without a net  
Without a net  
I had him up to the house one time  
And we was having a real good time  
Then he went and lain  
His Saddle in the rain  
  
In a laundromat not too far  
From the Alamo  
Sits a girl who stole my records  
Very long ago  
And she wishes, wants and washes  
Out those dirty clothes  
As she shuts her eyes and dreams  
About her one eyed Joe  
One eyed Joe  
Car parked on a dirty road  
Heaven knows the load she pulled  
Couldn't take the strain

Something's gone, I can't explain  
The heat is missing from the plain  
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain  
There's something wrong with you and me  
When more than one adds up to three  
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say  
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
when you do what you do without love, without love  
  
I'm gonna paint a picture of you  
The only colour I need is blue  
You're out of love, baby you know it's true  
Tell me why and I'll try to understand  
  
Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
When you do what you do without love  
  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say

And we'll just dress our love up in the skies  
And I'll show what that means!!

It's time to misbehave  
Don't leave me lonely  
I can't leave you alone tonight  
You don't need my permission  
When you're in that position,  
When you hold me  
I can't leave you alooone!

And you realise you've been drinking all of your years like wine?  
You're gambling with time and you know you just can't win  
But still you feel that somehow you've just got to keep on trying  
And woman, it's your heart I hear crying  
Now the young man by your side is your husband, or so you say  
In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace  
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms  
Oh, but his youth has made you hate to see his face  
And woman, it's your heart I see crying  
Now you're standing like some tree, oh, and the blossom has blown away  
And the last leaf has gone crumbling tumbling towards the ground  
You have nothing to teach me, just have nothing at all to say  
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you
have found

Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream  
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign  
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind  
  
They said, ""get back, honky cat  
Better get back to the woods.""  
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways  
And, oh, the change is gonna do me good  
  
You better get back, honky cat  
Living in the city ain't where it's at  
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine  
It's like trying to drink whiskey from a bottle of wine  
  
Well, I read some books, and I read some magazines  
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans  
And all the folks back home, well, said I was a fool  
They said, ""oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule.""  
  
They said, ""stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm  
Living in the city, boy, is going to break your heart.""  
But how can you stay when your heart says no?  
How can you stop when your feet say go?

Strangers meet and they willingly surrender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no  
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow  
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go  
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes  
  
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way  
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet  
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

Christmas to remember, too good to believe  
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again  
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind  
  
And you've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
We loved and laughed and played and joked  
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks  
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes  
Then to the lodge for dinner  
But now it's time for us to go  
As our hearts melt like chimney snow  
There's just one thing I want to know  
Can we do this next winter  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer

I used to practice day and night.  
My pals all roared as I fumbled at a chord,  
But I couldn't get the darned thing right.  
  
They laughed when I started to play, they laughed so hearty.  
Only two lessons I had, I went up the scale and down the scale,  
It wasn't so bad  
But one chap, he said ""Oh what a mug, why you can't learn that way""  
He took the uke off me and said ""Now I'll have a try""  
Just then the 'g' string bust and flew right into his eye.  
He laughed when I started to play, but he didn't laugh again all day  
  
Oh they laughed when I started to play, oh they laughed so hearty  
Strip poker that's a good game,  
Once I lost my trousers to a gambling dame  
But when, I started shuffling the cards, then the luck came my way.  
I won a frock and undies, she was left I declare  
As bare as any savage and as savages are bear  
She laughed when I started to play,  
But she didn't laugh again that day.  
  
Now once I watched a game of water polo,  
With players from a ladies school.  
The girls all cried ""Won't you make up a side?""  
So I dashed into the bathing pool.  
They laughed when I started to play, oh how they laughed so hearty.  
In goal, I paddled about, a big ball in the water soon I started to clout.  
Each time, that it came bobbing back, well I smacked it away.  
Just then the ball turned over and a girl said ""No larks"",  
""Seven times you've hit me where I can't show the marks.""  
She laughed when I started to play,  
But she didn't laugh again that day.

Spilling their sons' blood like table wine

Dangling from inside the fifth direction

Kings of mountains one day dust  
A lesson learned, a loving God, and things in their own time  
In nothing more do I trust  
  
But we own nothing, nothing is ours  
Not even love so fierce it burns like baby stars  
But this poverty is our greatest gift  
The weightlessness of us as things around begin to shift

I feel like a fool to be longing for that lyin' summer love  
  
Once we both loved just a bit too hard  
For deep down we both knew it was dyin'  
And we both talked just a little about forever  
But we both knew we were doing some lyin'.  
  
Now the snow falls, freezing my hurt for you  
But some nights I feel it's still there.  
I've come back now to the life I've known before you  
But I doesn't have the same old meaning.

The old man said to me  
Long before these crowded streets  
Here stood my dreaming tree  
Below it he would sit  
For hours at a time  
Now progress takes away  
What forever took to find  
And now he's falling hard  
He feels the falling dark  
How he longs to be  
Beneath his dreaming tree  
Conquered fear to climb  
A moment froze in time  
When the girl who first he kissed  
Promised him she'd be his  
Remembered mother's words  
There beneath the tree  
No matter what the world  
You'll always be my baby  
Mommy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
The air is growing thick  
A fear he cannot hide  
The dreaming tree has died

Have you no pity  
This thing I do  
I do not deny it  
All through this smile  
As crooked as danger  
I do not deny  
I know in my mind  
I would leave you now  
If I had the strength to  
I would leave you up  
To your own devices  
Will you not talk  
Can you take pity  
I don't ask much  
But won't you speak  
Please  
  
From the start  
She knew she had it made  
Easy up 'til then  
For sure she'd make the grade  
Adorers came in hordes  
To lay down in her wake  
She gave it all she had  
But treasures slowly fade  
Now she's falling hard  
She feels the fall of dark  
How did this fall apart  
She drinks to fill it up  
A smile of sweetest flowers  
Wilted so and soured  
Black tears stain the cheeks  
That once were so admired  
She thinks when she was small  
There on her father's knee  
How he had promised her  
You'll always be my baby  
Daddy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
I can't find my way home  
There is no place to hide  
The dreaming tree has died

If I had the strength to  
I would leave you up  
To your own devices  
Will you not talk  
Can you take pity

Two people walk alone  
Wondering in the fading light  
If they can find their home  
When hope is almost gone  
A distant light appears

Almost here for those in doubt  
For those who must remain  
Left behind when love goes cold  
And shifting life makes change  
  
Almost here for dreamers  
Who think that there's a chance  
That they will find their music  
And a partner for the dance  
  
There's a dream that doesn't die

But I think you can see yourself.  
How can the mirror affect you?  
  
Can you hear me  
Or do I surmise?  
That you fear me can you feel my temper

Raising hell even as a child  
Nothing's change since that day  
You still are runnin' wild  
How hell I'm gonna tell you  
And closer barriers are passing by  
Well you left this state and running  
Is air too smooth these days  
I think it's time to come down  
you'll gonna have to mend your way  
Put your head up in the clouds  
Can not see through the haze  
  
Step outside Take a look around  
Do you see anyone who cares?  
Passed your whole life stepping on your friends  
Still your in nowhere  
Search for a new direction  
But the Past is all you'll find  
You can count upon your mistake  
Blame it on your criminal mind  
When you lay down your snakes  
Come up poisoned every time.

When you find strange hands in your sweater  
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote  
I'm a man with a mission on two or three editions.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look

Chapter One: We didn't really get along.  
Chapter Two: I think I fell in love with you.  
You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three  
  
But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four  
Five and Six.  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
The way you walk  
The way you talk and try to kiss me  
And laugh in four or five paragraphs.  
All your compliments and your cutting remarks  
Are captured here in my quotation marks.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
Everyday I write the book.  
Don't tell me you don't know the difference  
Between a lover and a fighter.  
With my pen and my electric typewriter  
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal  
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.

No obstacles in sight  
My skies are clear tonight (My skies are full of light)  
I keep thinking I might see that cloud arrive  
Oh but there's no sign of it  
No sign of it  
  
And as I look around, it's all new ground  
The leaves on the trees touch down  
But I'm above weightless as a dream  
It's been a long road, a heavy load  
I just simply had to go  
Had to get here hard as it's been  
  
In and out of luck

I got a new life baby, it takes some getting  
Used to but...

They were closer now Fernando

I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Round like a broken speeding statue.

He must he must he must be intoxicated

We start from the dark  
  
You'll never pass for someone  
Who'll find a place in life  
You'd sooner take that last breath  
To give away your heart and mind  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
Start from the dark  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark

P!nk,Is This Thing On?,/p/pnk/is+this+thing+on_21040858.html,"Got your voicemail, can you call me at a hotel?  
There's something that's weighting heavy on my heart  
And heavy on my chest!  
I'm the lone night, you're the morning  
I annoy you, and you bore me  
And it's hard enough to make it through a... Zone of enemies  
All in good time, we'll be just fine  
Either way we need to be happy!  
  
Chorus:  
Tell me, is this thing still on?  
How do I keep it true?  
How do I keep you into me,  
Into me without faking it too  
What do we have to try,  
When everything is too lose?  
Cause it always is just me and you  
But it's the hardest thing to do,  
The hardest thing to do!  
  
And I want you, to want me, like the first time you saw me  
I know in ten years I'm betting my head is still young and dumb  
It would be so hard to let go and replace you, I still love you  
I just wanna find the thing that made me think this was the one!  
All in good time, we'll be just fine  
Either way we need to be happy!  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
Tell me, is this thing still on?  
How do I keep it true?

When everything is too lose

Madonna,American Pie,/m/madonna/american+pie_20086940.html,"A long long time ago  
I can still remember  
How that music used to make me smile  
And I knew that if I had one chance  
I could make those people dance  
And maybe they'd be happy for awhile  
  
Did you write the book of love  
And do you have faith in God above  
If the bible tells you so  
Now do you believe in rock n roll  
And can music save your mortal soul  
And can it teach me how to dance real slow  
Well I know that your in love with him  
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym  
You both kicked off your shoes  
And I did Gods rhythm and blues  
I was a lonely teenage brock of luck  
With a great carnation and a pick up truck  
But I knew that I was out of luck  
The day the music died  
I started singing  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
I met a girl who sang the blues  
And I asked her for some happy news  
But she just smiled and turned away  
Well I went down to the sachet store  
Where I heard the music years before  
But the man there said the music wouldn't play  
Well now in the streets the children screamed  
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed  
But not a word was spoken  
The church bells all broken  
And the three men I admire the most,  
The father, son, and the holy ghost  
They caught the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  
I started singing  
  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy

Her heart is in my hand  
It shivers like a toad  
She tries to understand the  
Tiny lump that's down inside her throat  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Her head is in my lap  
It twists and coughs and sings  
Her hair is in my grasp  
It hangs and swings like swollen strings  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Her face is inside out  
An open book report  
I read what she's about  
And she's filled with words that hurt  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Sometimes I want her in  
Sometimes I want her out  
My perception of sin  
Is filled with pain and fear and doubt  
  
She she she she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
She she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
  
Her clothes are on the ground  
A crumpled rainbow mass  
She's scattered all around  
And she's scattered now like broken glass  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Sometimes I want her in  
Sometimes I want her out

Is filled with pain and fear and doubt

I'm burning up inside cause

From people that I meet in the street  
They are turning cold  
Without you I would not be complete  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause

Why did you write me in a letter  
A word from you would be much better  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man  
  
Don't cast me aside  
Without you I could never survive  
Why did you decide  
To kill the love that keeps me alive

Garth Brooks,I Don't Have To Wonder,/g/garth+brooks/i+dont+have+to+wonder_20058150.html,"Drove to the church  
In my suit and tie  
But I just couldn't bring myself  
To go inside  
So I sat alone  
In my truck across the street  
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes  
By that long white limousine  
I could just imagine  
What was goin' on in there  
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass  
And those flowers in her hair  
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall  
Those bells rang loud as thunder  
As they opened up the doors  
Now I don't have to wonder anymore  
Laughin' and a cryin'  
Tossin' that bouquet  
And when you got in that limo  
I drove off the other way  
And I still don't know  
Why things happened like they did  
But I parked that old pickup  
On that lonesome river bridge  
I took your ring from my pocket  
And I held it one last time  
Watched that diamond sparkle  
I drew back and I let her fly  
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall  
Oh that old ring went under  
Lord and now it's gone for sure  
No and I don't have to wonder anymore  
Well the angels sang like thunder  
As I felt myself go under  
Now I don't have to wonder anymore

We had some very good times  
Me and my goose his name was Al  
And he cost only a dime  
  
Over meadows we'd stray  
Playing all day  
I missed him at night until dawn  
Then one day I found he wasn't around  
I wondered where Al could have gone  
  
I looked everywhere he just wasn't there  
Where could a goose be all day  
I miss my pal  
I miss my Al  
It's sad that things turned out this way  
  
Then mom brought him  
I remember her grin  
Stuffed with his feet pointed straight  
  
I'll never forget the night that we ate  
Al off of the old yellow plate
